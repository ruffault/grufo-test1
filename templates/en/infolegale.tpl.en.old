<h3><span class="deco">></span>ARTICLE 2: ORDERS AND ITEM AVAILABILITY</h3>

  own database, which is compiled by its teams and uses information communicated 
  by its suppliers. This database covers 4,000 items and all items are not held 
  as stock in the bookseller. As a result, the buyer's order will be met 
  while stocks last at La Maison du Dictionnaire and subject to stock available 
  from the supplier.
  <br /><br />
  La Maison du Dictionnaire informs the buyer as to the availability
  of the products he intends to buy during the order entry process. If however, 
  despite all care taken, certain products should prove temporarily unavailable 
  (stock shortage, reprint, etc.) following the acceptance of your order, the Maison 
  du Dictionnaire will inform you by e-mail, giving you the option of waiting for or 
  cancelling your order for these products.
  Where products prove permanently unavailable (out of stock, book not 
  republished, etc.), the Maison du Dictionnaire will automatically cancel  
  the order and inform the buyer by e-mail.
  <br /><br />
  By confirming an order, the buyer agrees to be bound by the 
  General Terms of Sale described on this site, and accepts
  that he has been informed of their content. Confirmation of this order,
  in addition to all the data registered by La Maison du 
  Dictionnaire will constitute proof of sale.
